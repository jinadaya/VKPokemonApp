# MyGameCollection

### Under active development

Idea: I just wanted to check all games that I ever played, completed or that I want at the moment, but there was no any good application to achieve all my needs.
So i decided to make my own because I able to do it and want it. So here it is!

- UI is fully implemented in Jetpack Compose
- DI is made with pure Dagger, so no Hilt and anything like that.
- Background tasks and asynchronous programming via kotlinx.Coroutines and Flows
